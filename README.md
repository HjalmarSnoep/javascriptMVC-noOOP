# Minimal Crud
A  minimal webapp example inspired by [this tutorial](http://web-engineering.info/tech/JsFrontendApp/minimal-tutorial.html#d5e1642)

### Minimal App
It's basically a rebuild of the minimal app.
But keeping in mind, what the students in the second year know about javascript yet.
Also I made it a little nicer looking, using CSS so it seems more like a real-world example.

### Next Step
The next step in this tutorial is importing and exporting the database using the blob (a concept I'll have to explain).
